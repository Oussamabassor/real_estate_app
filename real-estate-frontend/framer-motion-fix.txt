# Fix for Framer Motion Version Mismatch

You're experiencing an error because you have two different versions of Framer Motion 
(12.6.1 and 12.6.2) being used in your project.

To fix this issue:

1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd c:\xampp\htdocs\real_estate_app\real-estate-frontend

3. Update Framer Motion to a consistent version:
   npm install framer-motion@12.6.2 --save
   
   OR if you use yarn:
   yarn add framer-motion@12.6.2

4. Restart your development server:
   npm run dev
   
   OR with yarn:
   yarn dev

This will ensure all components use the same version of Framer Motion.
